### Demonstration: https://qualuo.github.io/Air-Defense-System/

Air defense system inspired by Israel's [Iron Dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome). The simulation launches attacking rockets from random positions and when detected by the launcher system, sends an interceptor [missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile) to take care of it. 

The system is not perfect, but so is reality: "On 10 March 2012, The Jerusalem Post reported that the system [Iron Dome] shot down 90% of rockets launched from Gaza that would have landed in populated areas." 

There are many variables to consider. More precise simulations can be made. Smarter techniques to implement. But as is, there are many parameters that can be adjust to get desired results, including mass, drag, angular drag, distances, force vectors, projection, timings, PID controller gains.
